          <td>C and C++</td>
          <td>
            many hackers used to develop hazardous programs and scripts in these two languages,

          <td>
            Python is a simple language to learn for novices, yet it is one of the greatest and most popular languages for hacking servers on the internet.
            In the case of automation, Python makes it easy to develop scripts.
            It contains a sizable library collection.
            Python is used to do network scanning, port scanning, and host discovery.</td>

          <td>JavaScript</td>
          <td>
            JavaScript is used to simulate assaults on the server or client-side, and it may also be used to produce adware.
            Cross-site scripting is commonly developed using JavaScript.
            Hackers use it to carry out buffer overflow attacks.
            JavaScript enables you to control event handlers and do Cross-Site Scripting 
            by allowing you to handle cookies and modify how they function (XSS).</td>

            When you have a good understanding of PHP, you will be able to take down defective websites as soon as you see one. 
            Integration of PHP-based solutions allows you to reduce, if not completely eliminate, cyber assaults. 
            PHP helps Cybersecurity Professionals to develop reliable website security solutions.
            PHP is also often used to hack into your websites (to explore bugs).</td>

              SQL injections are used by black hat hackers to get unlashed credentials from databases. 
              SQL injections are created by hackers using SQL queries to steal data from users.
              You will be able to alter the database according to your needs if you have a solid understanding and command of SQL.
              Because SQL injections are one of the most prevalent dangers to online applications, knowing SQL can help you avoid them.</td>
